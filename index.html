<h3>Our research.</h3>

<p>
Our goal to study how standardized system abstractions are
being used by modern workloads, and whether they are
being replaced by other abstractions. We are interested in a broad set of
questions that are intimately entwined with the future of systems design and
application development, such as:

<li>
Which POSIX abstractions are still being used and relevant for
today's application workloads?
</li>

<li>
Which abstractions are being replaced by new and non-standard
abstractions?
</li>

<li>
Are there any specific limitations of traditional abstractions
that motivate these transitions?
</li>

<li>
Are the replacement abstractions similar in the various OSes, or
are they diverging?
</li>

<li>
Are there any blatantly missing abstractions in POSIX, which modern
workloads appear to require? If so, how are the gaps currently being filled?
</li>

<li>
Are any traditional abstractions being used in ways for which they
were not intended? If so, what are the performance or security implications
of these uses?
</li>

<p>
<p>
<p>
We believe that the answers to these questions will be
relevant to a wide audience, including: researchers, who can design and
optimize their systems by leveraging current, broadly applicable trends in
application workloads;
application developers, who may take advantage of new and more powerful
abstractions available in modern OSes; standard bodies, such as
OpenGroup, who may wish to reconsider certain, obsolete aspects of their
standard in light of the new trends; and educators, who may wish to refresh
their courses with coverage of the new, prominent OS abstractions that are
replacing traditional ones.
